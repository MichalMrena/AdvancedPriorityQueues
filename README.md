# Advanced Priority Queues
My bachelors thesesis where I examined couple of interesting priority queues points to this repo. Originally it contained implementations of these queues in C++. In my opinion the code I wrote was quite ugly so right now I am doing some refactoring and when I am done I will reupload implementations of **Brodal queue** and **Strict Fibonacci heap**.
